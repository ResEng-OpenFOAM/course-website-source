## Module Objectives

In this first modules, we'll (not in this order though, but it's really
your call!):

- Set up a __LinuxOne Community server__ to try our light
  (but possibly parallel) simulations on.
- Learn how OpenFOAM represents fluid flow problems.
- Learn how OpenFOAM files are structured.
- Get introduced to few terms we use frequently.
- Browse around OpenFOAM's installation and make a distinction between
  different versions and forks of the software.
