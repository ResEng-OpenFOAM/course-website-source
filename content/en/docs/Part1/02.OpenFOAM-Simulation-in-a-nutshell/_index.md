Welcome to the second module of this part of the course, which tries to provide
a 10000-foot view onhow OpenFOAM simulations work. We'll do that by actually
simulating a simple transport problem, both manually and with the help of
OpenFOAM solvers; then comparing both methods even in how results should be
visualized in each case.

## Module Objectives

In this modules, we'll

- Attempt to simulate a simplified fluid flow problem with OpenFOAM.
- Compare OpenFOAM workflow to a manual solution to the same problem using the
  Finite Volume Method.
- Get to know the very basics of visualizing OpenFOAM results with ParaView.

Let's get started.
